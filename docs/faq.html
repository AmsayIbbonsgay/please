    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h3>Can I run it on my computer?</h3>

    <p>If you're running Linux or OSX, definitely; we actively support both those platforms.<br/>
      We primarily test on Ubuntu but other distros should work fine too.<br/>
      It's probably possible to port to BSD with a little work.</p>

    <p>Windows is unfortunately not supported natively, since it's just too different from the
      Unix environment Please is designed for. It might well be possible to make it work using
      Cygwin or MinGW / MSYS though. We aren't doing this work ourselves because we don't
      have any Windows machines at work, but we're happy to accept PRs in that direction.</p>


    <h3>What's the licence?</h3>

    <p>TODO(all): decide! I suggest Apache-2.0 which both Buck and Bazel use.</p>


    <h3>Why use Please instead of go build / Maven / Gradle?</h3>

    <p>Cross-language support is a big advantage; we have four main languages in use at Thought Machine
      (Javascript, Python, Java and Go) plus several smaller pieces (some C++ and Thrax grammars) and
      having to invoke different compilers and/or test tools for each one would be extremely tiresome.</p>

    <p>Initially we tried Gradle for a while, since the oldest parts of our codebase are Java and we
      strongly preferred its file format over Ant and Maven. Extending it to other languages didn't
      look easy and even for a single-language project, Please is considerably faster.</p>

    <p>Please can also integrate many different kinds of build steps; for example a code generation
      step using <code>go generate</code> or <code>protoc</code> can be invoked dynamically without
      having to check the resulting code into the repository.</p>


    <h3>Why use Please instead of Bazel, Buck or Pants?</h3>

    <p>All four of these systems are quite closely related in the scheme of things, being inspired by
      (or in Bazel's case, a direct open sourcing of) Google's Blaze.</p>

    <p>Several of us had worked at Google and used Blaze extensively there; we were excited about it being
      open sourced as Bazel but by then we were already using Please internally. It's a great system but
      we have slightly different goals, specifically we're aiming Please at being lighter weight and
      pushing the boundaries of what can be done within the BUILD language. Since Please is written in
      Go there's no runtime dependency on the JVM (unless you have Java rules in your repo, of course).
    </p>

    <p>We actually used Buck for some months internally before deciding to write Please and before it
      was capable of building our repo. We preferred it to other options available, but again we're
      focused on different goals; Please is easier to extend to new languages, has a bunch of features
      that we specifically wanted (e.g. test containerisation) and again doesn't require a JVM.<br/>
      Please also has a stronger focus on correctness; we made some mistakes in writing our own rules at
      first which resulted in some flaky build failures and/or bad performance. These kinds of mistakes
      should be much harder to make with Please.</p>

    <p>We're least familiar with Pants; one of our developers briefly tried it and while we liked
      many aspects we thought Buck would be a closer fit for what we needed. Again, we feel Please
      is easier to extend to other languages due to more powerful BUILD language primitives.</p>


    <h3>What inspired the design of Please?</h3>

    <p>Originally Blaze, since a number of us had used it at Google. More recently we'd used Buck
      internally so many things superficially resemble that for compatibility reasons
      (e.g. <code>python_binary</code> instead of <code>py_binary</code> etc).</p>

    <p>Some of the advanced features are based on things we would have liked to do with Blaze, for example
      being able to defer creation of some build rules until they actually need to be built. This is
      only really of interest for spectacularly large trees of targets though.</p>


    <h3>How does Please build itself? Do I need Please to build Please?</h3>

    <p>Please bootstraps itself using <code>go build</code> to build a temporary version of itself,
      which is then used to rebuild itself using its own BUILD rules. This requires a little
      duplication between the initial bootstrap script and the BUILD rules but obviously we
      can't rely on anyone building it already having a version of it installed.</p>

    <p>Fortunately the process is pretty fast since Go is fast to compile.</p>


    <h3>Why write it in Go?</h3>

    <p>We eliminated most other languages through a process of elimination; JVM languages were
      ruled out because the startup overhead is too high, we were concerned about Python's
      threading performance for an inherently parallel system and felt C++ was too fiddly and
      lacked a strong standard library. Rust was still pre-1.0 at the time (although that didn't
      take long, as it turned out) so we felt it was a bit early to leap into that although
      it was interesting.</p>

    <p>It also turned out to be a really useful way of learning the language; the project is
      about the right size to explore it properly and sufficiently self-contained not to
      affect other parts of our repo until we were sure Go was a language we wanted to do more of.</p>

    <p>We're very happy with the results; the performance of native binaries is excellent,
      the language was easy to become productive with and has great support for all the things
      we needed to do with it. Our early concerns (eg. the classic "no generics!")
      turned out to be a lot less problematic than we expected.</p>

    <p>An alternative explanation is that the original high-level design meeting for Please was
      an impromptu discussion in a pub one Friday evening, where we thought it would be a neat
      language to try despite none of us having any real experience with it.</p>


    <h3>Is this the primary repo, or do you have a secret internal version too?</h3>

    <p>This is the only repository; all development is done here. Initially we had an internally
      hosted repo but transferred the project to Github in preparation for open sourcing it.

    <p>We've got some build rules in our internal repo that aren't built into Please yet.
      We intend to move them into this repo as we can, but the ones left aren't easy to genericise
      for various reasons.</p>


    <h3>What do the colours in the console output mean?</h3>

    <p>They change based on the type of rule that's being built:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Yellow: Go</li>
      <li>Green: Python</li>
      <li>Red: Java</li>
      <li>Blue: Javascript</li>
      <li>Cyan: Parsing a BUILD file</li>
      <li>Magenta: Third party dependencies</li>
      <li>White: Anything else.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Libraries are normal weight, binaries (including tests) are bold.</p>


    <h3>Why's it called Please?</h3>

    <p>Because we liked the idea of sounding polite when typing "plz build", "plz test", etc.<br/>
      Also we chose the domain name before almost anything else (priorities!).</p>
