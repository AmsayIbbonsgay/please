This is a prebuilt image based on Alpine Linux which contains
everything you should need to build Please.
Note that to use a pre-downloaded Please in an Alpine environment
you would need to add the glibc-compat package.

Run the following to get started:
 git clone https://github.com/thought-machine/please.git
 cd please
 ./bootstrap.sh
